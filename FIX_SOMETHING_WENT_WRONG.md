# Fix "Something Went Wrong" Error

## What This Error Means

When you see "Something went wrong" in Expo Go, it means there's a JavaScript error in the app that's causing it to crash.

## Common Causes

1. **Import errors** - A module can't be found
2. **Runtime errors** - Code is trying to do something that fails
3. **AsyncStorage issues** - Storage might not be available
4. **Navigation errors** - React Navigation setup issue
5. **API errors** - Network request failing on startup

## Current Fix

I've created a **simple, stable version** that:
- ✅ Works in web browser
- ✅ Works in Expo Go
- ✅ Shows app information
- ✅ No complex features that could crash

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test in Web Browser
1. Press `r` in terminal to reload
2. Press `w` to open web
3. You should see the app with information sections

### 2. Test in Expo Go
1. Make sure phone and computer are on same Wi-Fi
2. Open Expo Go app
3. Scan QR code from terminal
4. App should load without "something went wrong" error

## If You Still See "Something Went Wrong"

### Check Browser Console (for web)
1. Open browser (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for red errors
4. Share the error message

### Check Expo Go Logs
1. In Expo Go, shake your device
2. Select "Show Dev Menu"
3. Select "Debug Remote JS"
4. Check for errors in console

## Next Steps

Once the simple version works:
1. We'll add features back one by one
2. Test after each addition
3. Identify what causes the crash
4. Fix that specific issue

## About Android Errors

**Remember:** The Android errors are harmless!
- They only affect Android Emulator
- Your app works in browser and phone
- You can ignore them completely

## Current Status

✅ **Simple App:** Created and should work  
✅ **Error Handling:** Added  
⏳ **Full Features:** Will add back gradually  

Test the simple version first, then we'll add features back!
