# ✅ Error Fixed!

## The Problem

**Error:** `Identifier 'Text' has already been declared`

**Cause:** `Text` was imported twice in ProfileScreen.tsx:
- Line 4: `Text` imported from 'react-native'
- Line 15: `Text` imported again from 'react-native' (duplicate!)

## The Fix

✅ **Removed duplicate import**
- Combined `Platform` into the first import statement
- Removed the duplicate import on line 15

## What This Means

- ✅ **Syntax error fixed** - app can now compile
- ✅ **Web bundling should work** - no more "Web Bundling failed"
- ✅ **App should load** - both in browser and Expo Go

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for server to restart** (clearing cache)
2. **Press `r` in terminal** to reload
3. **Press `w`** to test web browser
4. **Scan QR code** to test Expo Go
5. **App should work now!**

## About Android Errors

**Remember:** The Android errors are still harmless!
- They only appear when you press `a`
- They don't affect your app
- Just ignore them or don't press `a`

Your app should be working now! 🎉
