# 🚨 CRITICAL: Move Project Out of OneDrive

## Problem
OneDrive is locking files during sync, preventing EAS Build from archiving your project.

## ✅ Solution: Move Project to Local Directory

### Step 1: Copy Project to Local Directory

1. **Open File Explorer**
2. **Navigate to:** `C:\Users\Farzeen\OneDrive\Desktop\Helloone.app`
3. **Copy the entire folder** (Ctrl+C)
4. **Navigate to:** `C:\Users\Farzeen\Desktop\`
5. **Paste the folder** (Ctrl+V)
   - New location: `C:\Users\Farzeen\Desktop\Helloone.app`

### Step 2: Open PowerShell in New Location

1. **Open PowerShell**
2. **Navigate to the new location:**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\Farzeen\Desktop\Helloone.app\mobile
   ```

### Step 3: Run Build Again

```powershell
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

## Why This Works

- ✅ Files are no longer locked by OneDrive sync
- ✅ EAS Build can access all files freely
- ✅ No permission denied errors

## Alternative: Pause OneDrive Sync

If you can't move the project:

1. **Right-click OneDrive icon** in system tray
2. **Click "Pause syncing"**
3. **Select "2 hours"** or "24 hours"
4. **Run the build**
5. **Resume syncing after build completes**

## After Moving

Your project will be at:
```
C:\Users\Farzeen\Desktop\Helloone.app
```

You can continue working from this location. OneDrive won't interfere with builds.
