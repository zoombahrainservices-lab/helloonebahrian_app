# Debug Steps - Finding the Issue

## Current Problem
- Simple app works ✅
- Full app shows nothing ❌

## Step-by-Step Testing

I've created a step-by-step test app. Here's how to use it:

### Step 1: Basic App (Should Work)
- Shows "HelloOne Bahrain - Step 1: Basic App ✅"
- If this doesn't work, there's a fundamental issue

### Step 2: Add Contexts
- Tap the hint text to go to Step 2
- Tests if contexts (Auth, Cart, Language) work
- If this fails, the issue is in one of the contexts

### Step 3: Add Navigation
- Tap the hint text to go to Step 3
- Tests if React Navigation works
- If this fails, the issue is in navigation

## How to Use

1. **Press `r` in terminal** to reload
2. **Press `w`** to open web
3. **You'll see Step 1** - confirm it works
4. **Tap the hint text** to test Step 2
5. **If Step 2 works, tap again** to test Step 3
6. **Tell me which step fails** - that's where the issue is!

## What to Check

### Browser Console (F12)
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for red errors
4. Share any errors you see

### Common Issues

**If Step 2 fails:**
- Issue is in AuthContext, CartContext, or LanguageContext
- Check browser console for specific error

**If Step 3 fails:**
- Issue is in React Navigation
- Might need web-specific navigation setup
- Check browser console for specific error

## Next Steps

Once we identify which step fails, I can fix that specific issue!
